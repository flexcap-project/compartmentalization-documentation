# Getting Started

!!! note TODO
    - Summarize the entire process from a high level point of view
    - Explain that automation is desirable but only certain parts of the process cna be automatized
        - Point out that most existing production-ready compartmentalized software was broken down manually in an ad-hoc way
        - List a few frameworks that can help, differentiate between research and vs. more mature (RLBox) approaches?
        - Point out that with our use case/running example we will compartmentalize fully manually so the reader can understand the process
    - Select a use case: the application should be simple enough to be compartmentalizable by a beginner, but also complex enough so that the process of compartmentalizing it involves:
        - Bidirectional communication between compartments
        - THe need for some degbree of interface securisation effort

For the remainder of the tutorial we will describe the steps needed when considering and implementing compartmentalization by considering a real application.
