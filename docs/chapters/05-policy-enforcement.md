# Enforcing the Policy

!!! note TODO
    - Complete here, leveraging the SoK as much as possible
    - Mechanisms and abstractions should be presented from a high level point of view
    - Zoom in on page tables which is the one we will be using with our running example, list its pros and cons
    - Explain what needs to happen with page tables:
        - need to build message-passing-based communication channels between compartment (with IPCs)
        - Could share memory too
        - Need to create multiple processes (likely `fork`)
    - Explain 
    - Create the tutorial part (at the end, or as a separate subchapter?), where we leverage our use case and decide on a policy
